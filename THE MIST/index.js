//TODO: help/look fx's
//* sameRoom() skips room descriptions after room actions when player didn't change room. look/help fx's can repeat description or show available commands
//TODO: weapon class constructor? (how will that change inventory rules? e.g. rifle)
//*ideas: HP, fx for randomized hits (maybe), inventory influences stats or something like that?
//TODO: enemies constructor (enemies extends Location? maybe to attach each enemy to locations??) + hp system + enemies locations
//TODO: build out player class to incl. inventory, weapons, equip/unequip
//TODO: look for DOM directions in sdb repo to add to this project
